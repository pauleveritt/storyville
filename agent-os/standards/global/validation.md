# Validation

- Always validate server-side
- Client-side for UX only (duplicate server-side)
- Fail early
- Clear, field-specific error messages
- Allowlists over blocklists
- Check types, formats, ranges, required fields
- Sanitize to prevent injection
- Validate business rules at app layer
- Apply consistently across all entry points
