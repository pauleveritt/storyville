# Development Conventions

- Predictable project structure
- Up-to-date README with setup/architecture
- Clear commit messages and PR descriptions
- Environment variables for config (no secrets in repo)
- Minimal, documented dependencies
- Code review before merge
- Feature flags over long-lived branches
