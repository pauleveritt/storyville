# Spec Initialization: UI Cosmetics

## Raw Idea

Make the `<main>` area a slightly-less black background color. Bring in a local copy of FontAwesome icons. Add a button in the far left of the Header to toggle the LayoutAside and give more room to Main. Use a FontAwesome icon for that. Add some JavaScript that looks at the URL and correctly expands the current node. Remove more top/bottom padding in the LayoutAside `aside > nav > details > ul > li` which has 10 units of padding top/bottom.

## Context

This spec aims to improve the visual polish and usability of the Storyville component browser interface. The changes focus on:
- Visual refinement (background colors, spacing)
- Adding icon support via FontAwesome
- Improving navigation UX with collapsible sidebar and automatic tree expansion
- Better use of screen real estate

## Status

Initialized - Ready for requirements gathering
