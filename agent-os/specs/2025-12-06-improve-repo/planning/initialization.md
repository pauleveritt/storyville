# Spec Initialization: Improve Repo - Create Composite Action

## User's Initial Description

Number 14 Improve Repo - Create composite action.

## Context

We've just created a composite action at `.github/actions/setup-python-uv/action.yml` that centralizes Python and uv setup across three GitHub Actions workflows (ci.yml, pages.yml, pypi.yml). This improves maintainability by avoiding duplication.
