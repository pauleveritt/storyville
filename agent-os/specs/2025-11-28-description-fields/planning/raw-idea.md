# Raw Idea

## Feature Name
Story/Subject/Section Description Fields

## Feature Description
Add into the rendered HTML the `description` field on `Story`, `Subject`, and `Section`.

## Context
This is roadmap item #9. The system already has a structure with Site → Section → Subject → Story hierarchy. This feature will enhance the web-based component browser by displaying description fields that are already defined on these entities.
