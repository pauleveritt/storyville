# Registry Context

When it comes to a registry, Storytime lets you either construction your own at each level of the tree or let Storytime construct it for you.
The latter is nice because you get to keep a subregistry tree with parents.

You might want the subregistry created with a context.
Thus, each level in the tree allows passing in a `context` to be used for the subregistry.
